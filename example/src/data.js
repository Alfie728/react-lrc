[00:13.73]You cover your wounds but underneath them
[00:17.74]A million voices in your head that whisper "Stop now"
[00:23.38]Another twist of the knife turn of the screws
[00:26.60]It's all in your mind and it's fighting you
[00:30.33]Arm yourself a storm is coming
[00:33.63]Well kid
[00:34.94]What you gonna do now
[00:40.84]It's your reflection looking back to pull you down
[00:46.44]So are you gonna die today or make it out alive
[00:51.96]You gotta conquer the monster in your head and then you'll fly
[00:56.82]Fly Phoenix fly
[01:00.31]It's time for a new empire
[01:02.81]Go bury your demons then tear down the ceiling
[01:08.47]Phoenix fly
[01:14.86]And now you're playing with matches come out of the ashes
[01:18.24]Underneath you a million voices in the crowd they're screaming "Stop now"
[01:26.28]Well let 'em swallow their pride you're turning the tide to true believers
[01:32.01]Got them in the palm of your hand you're playing God now
[01:37.86]What you gonna do now
[01:43.65]It's your reflection looking back to pull you down
[01:49.32]So are you gonna die today or make it out alive
[01:54.77]You gotta conquer the monster in your head and then you'll fly
[01:59.74]Fly Phoenix fly
[02:03.10]It's time for a new empire
[02:05.68]Go bury your demons then tear down the ceiling

    lrc: `[00:28.41]为着什么追赶到头来有变质吗
[00:35.34]日夜扮演开心角色吗 却总一个面对
[00:42.41]一个 流浪哪一街角找哪份寄托
[00:49.02]一个 闹市中却只得我
[00:55.49]这刹那却想到至亲的说话
[01:02.14]如若迷失请谨记回家
[01:06.19]迷路不要惊怕
[01:08.95]前路难关都给你招架
[01:12.83]如像孩子那样靠着我不怕
[01:19.72]好好的放一假
[01:23.76]重整理内心积压再出发
[01:36.13]望着父亲不经已白头发也斑斑
[01:42.66]家中每一位都尚好吗 我不敢致电你
[01:49.90]生怕 提及我的一切可会令你心挂
[01:56.77]生怕 说到声线变沙哑
[02:03.00]还未成功不敢说回家
[02:06.97]要再打拼一下
[02:09.79]同学们纷纷都已出嫁
[02:13.76]仍在留守这地 努力往上爬
[02:20.64]多少风雨洗刷
[02:24.60]还可有力气抵抗吗
[02:30.01]要记住回头看现状
[02:33.74]会发现已过三关斩了六将
[02:41.62]曾亦有灰色思绪在扩张
[02:46.45]你却是往日灿烂模样
[02:49.65]默默地为我在燃亮
[03:21.01]如若迷失请谨记回家
[03:24.91]迷路不再惊怕
[03:27.57]前路难关都给我招架
[03:31.50]犹幸能得你护荫 做你 亲手栽种的花
[03:39.34]若跌倒纵使满身伤痕沉沦在流沙
[03:46.08]我都不怕
[03:47.08]也得你的双手引路回家
[03:55.80]再都不怕`,
